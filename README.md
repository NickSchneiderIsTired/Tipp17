# Tipp17
Simple typing-game to improve your typing-speed. No external libraries used so just really simple graphics.

The game renders letters dropping from the top of the screen. In order to remove them you simply need to press the letter on the keyboard.
If you miss a letter a grey "border" will be visible on the top. The more you miss, the lower it gets, so making the game harder.
If you press a key which's letter is not on the screen you will get "miss" point (red), otherwise you get a score-point (yellow).
